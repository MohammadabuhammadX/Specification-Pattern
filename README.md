⚙️ Overview
The Specification Pattern encapsulates business rules (predicates) into reusable, composable objects. Each specification represents one criterion—such as filtering, sorting, or paging—that can be combined with others using boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT) to build complex queries in a clean, testable way .

📦 Getting Started
 Prerequisites
- .NET 6+ SDK
-EF Core 8+ (for primitive collection support)

Installation

git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-spec-pattern-repo.git
cd your-spec-pattern-repo
dotnet restore
dotnet build


✅ Benefits
-Separation of Concerns: Query logic lives in specs, not controllers or services .

-Reusability: Compose simple specs into complex rules without duplication.

-Testability: Unit-test each specification in isolation.

-Maintainability: Adding or tweaking filters doesn’t modify repository code—just update or combine specs.
